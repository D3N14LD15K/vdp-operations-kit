# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (Template)

**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

We welcome good-faith reports to help keep our patients, customers, and platforms safe.

## Scope (grows quarterly)
- In-scope today: [list at least one internet-accessible system or product].
- Quarterly scope expansion until all internet-accessible systems are covered.

## Allowed Testing
- No exploitation beyond proof of vulnerability.
- No PHI/PII exfiltration or access to live clinical environments.
- No social engineering, physical testing, or volumetric DoS.

## How to Report
- Email: security@yourdomain.com (PGP preferred) â€” anonymous submissions accepted.
- Please include: asset, steps to reproduce, impact, and any relevant logs/screenshots (with redaction).

## Our Commitments
- Acknowledge within **3 business days**; triage within **7 days**.
- We do not pursue legal action against good-faith research within this policy.
- We will keep you informed of progress and coordinate public disclosure (default 90 days or sooner if actively exploited).

## Safe Harbor
We authorize testing of in-scope assets under this policy and waive restrictions in Terms of Service solely for the purpose of good-faith security research conducted within these rules.

## Recognition
If permitted, we may publicly thank researchers after remediation.
